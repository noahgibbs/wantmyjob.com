  - Inform user of matching jobs at some reasonable times
  - Usefully view your own profile
  - Specs for UtterlyNaiveMatch calculations

Monitoring:
  - Daily RSS feed of vital info like total users, logins & questions, etc.

Possible Match Solution:
  - start counting karma points, use them up to get job evaluations

Testing/Prototyping:

Important, but probably not release 1:

    entered, unless that date has been changed manually at some point

Formatting and Prettiness:

  - Custom 404 page
  - Trim invalid links from various devise and registration views
  - Add an "about" link
  - Add a "privacy" link
  - Pretty up scaffolding views for profiles, answers, questions, etc
