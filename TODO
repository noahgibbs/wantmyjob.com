Release 1, MVP:

  - Allow users to match with jobs every hour or so, by pushing a button
    - Prevent doing it constantly
  - Usefully view matches
    - Pretty up view
  - Specs for UtterlyNaiveMatch calculations

Monitoring:
  - Daily RSS feed of vital info like total users, logins & questions, etc.
  - App console with the same info, and exceptions

Auditing:
  - turn on paper_trail

Testing/Prototyping:

  - Add toggle to show or not show demo profiles for matches
  - Enter a bunch of demo profiles for matches

Important, but probably not release 1:

  - Cucumber tests
  - Karma points
  - Figure skipped questions into Wilson score somehow
  - Use delayed_job for updating matches

Usability:

  - When entering jobs, set start_date on following row to end_date just
    entered, unless that date has been changed manually at some point
  - Cut down on the number of redirects

Formatting and Prettiness:

  - Custom 404 page
  - Trim invalid links from various devise and registration views
