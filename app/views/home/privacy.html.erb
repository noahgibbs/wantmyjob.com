    Hi, I'm Noah!  I don't like it when people sell my email address,
    so I won't sell yours.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your profile information here is basically public.  The site exists
    to point you at jobs other people have entered, and to point other
    people at jobs you've entered, so you should consider your list of
    jobs to be public information.  I don't publicize a list of what
    jobs I've recommended to you in particular, but I don't treat
    recommendations as basically private.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't make it easy for somebody to see what you've said about
    which workplace &ndash; but there are some ways that somebody
    dedicated could figure it out, maybe.  So just maybe an employer
    could realize you're not being terribly complimentary about them,
    but they'd have to work at it and get lucky.
  </p>

  <p>
    I try hard not to give out contact information.  If this place becomes
    yet another feeding frenzy of recruiters, we all lose.  So I try to
    keep the email contact minimal and controllable, but I *do* allow
    some of it through the site &ndash; most people want to hear about
    good new matches or interesting messages.  I don't give out your
    information to let other people contact you.
