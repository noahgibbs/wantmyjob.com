  Looking for jobs at WMJ?  Information about our VCs and funding?
  The fax number for the corporate office?  We're too small to have
  any of that.  Sorry!  My email address is on the upper right of
  the page up there, if you've got questions.  I'm friendly!

  <h2> Why WantMyJob? </h2>

  <p>
    Job hunting is painful for anybody in high tech.  It's hard to get
    an honest description of a job.  It's hard to get a real list of
    jobs.  It sucks for employees
    <i>and</i> companies.  Companies waste lots of money on it.  Headhunters
    get paid huge amounts of money to mercilessly badger candidates
    who aren't interested and don't match the job.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most job descriptions are so generic they're useless.  Some are a pack
    of lies.  Want to know what working at the company is like?
    Good luck with that.  Good jobs get buried, bad jobs look good,
    and you just can't tell what's what.
  </p>

  <p>
    And as coworkers, we hate hiring somebody that just
    doesn't fit.  Too negative?  Too positive?  Too trendy?  Too
    stressed?  Sure, he'd be great somewhere else, but we hired
    him <i>here</i>, and now what do we do?  How could we have known
    in advance?
  </p>

  <h2> And so... </h2>

  <p>
    I ask you and a bunch of other people about yourselves and
    places you've worked.  I wrote a bunch of code and math to
    match you up where you'll fit.  Bad jobs don't attract good
    candidates, Steelers fans can avoid all-Cowboys offices, and it's
    ponies and rainbows for everyone!  Yay!
  </p>

  <h2> Why the Heavy Slant toward Computer Programmers? </h2>

  <p>
    I write what I know.  Also, computer programmers have the problems
    above in spades.
  </p>

  <p>
    With that said, there should definitely be better questions for
    people in your line of work.  Suggest questions for the
    site!  If we get too many weird
    questions that don't apply to most users and their jobs, we'll
    find a way to fix that, I promise.
