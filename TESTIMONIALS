[WantMyJob] is an interesting take on recruitment. Instead of looking
for jobs based on keywords, want my job asks you questions about your
ideal work environment, job history and so on then provides you with a
match. It's a very different way of looking at recruitment compared to
the sites I've used and I quite like the idea of better refinement of
choices based on personality type as well as experience. You can
suggest questions to add as well. It's a bit rough around the edges
(the site says so, and I had a couple of errors) but it shows a lot of
potential. If Want My Job can get a decently sized database of jobs
then they could be on to a winner.
